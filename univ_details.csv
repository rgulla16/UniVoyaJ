Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),Northern America,United States,1861,77 Massachusetts Avenue,http://web.mit.edu/,"The essence of MIT is our appetite for problemsââespecially those big, intractable, complicated problems whose solutions make a permanent difference. While MIT is a research university committed to world-class inquiry in math, science, and engineering, MIT has equally distinguished programs in architecture, the humanities, management, and the social sciences. A diverse, supportive campus environmentââwith an incredible range of student groups and athletic and fitness opportunitiesââensures that it's not all about the work. And in MIT's intensely creative atmosphere, the arts flourish in all their forms.
MIT admits some of the most talented students in the world on a need-blind basis. The Institute is committed to meeting the financial need of each admitted undergraduate student through MIT Scholarships; the average need-based scholarship was $51,500 in 2018. As a result, the MIT community is incredibly diverse, and organically collaborative, with students coming from many different backgrounds, across the country and around the world.
Students are frequently encouraged to unite MITâs engineering excellence with public service. For example, the required senior capstone design course for mechanical engineering majors centers on making the world a better place through engineering. Recent years have focused on projects using alternative forms of energy, and machines that could be used for sustainable agriculture. Beyond academic coursework, MITâs D-Lab, Poverty Action Lab, and Public Service Center all support students and professors in the research and implementation of culturally sensitive and environmentally responsible technologies and programs that alleviate poverty and improve quality of life in low-income areas locally, nationally, and worldwide.
MITâs preeminence in entrepreneurship is rooted in its founding. As one of the first land-grant colleges, the Institute was designed to deliver a practical education rather than to focus on the classical education that was provided by many private universities of the era. This emphasis on practice is infused into the entrepreneurship curriculum and programming, which emphasizes learning by doing. Over the course of the 2018â2019 academic year, more than 500 entrepreneurship courses were offered.
Several MIT departments, labs, and centers foster entrepreneurship and innovation at MIT including the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, the MIT Sandbox Innovation Fund Program, and the MIT Innovation Initiative to name a few. MIT also has over 40 student clubs and initiatives involved in entrepreneurship or innovation, among them the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, MIT Clean Energy Prize, and conferences such as Hacking Arts and Hacking Medicine.
The MIT community brings its energy and creativity outside the classroom as well with 450+ student-run groups, 33 varsity sports, 27 intramural sports, 35 club sports, and more than 50 music, theater, visual arts, writing, and dance groups. Itâs just a short walk across the Charles River to Boston where students can enjoy the cityâs fabulous restaurants and culture. Many programs around MIT allow students to get reduced-price tickets to various events, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the American Repertory Theater, and Bruins, Celtics, and Red Sox games. Students get free admission daily to the Museum of Science, the Museum of Fine Arts, and all Harvard University and MIT museums."

With more than 40,000 students, a distinguished faculty, over 250 degree programs, and alumni in positions of national and international leadership, Berkeley today is a large and complex institution offering students a vast range of scholarly endeavor and a wide arena for personal growth.The campus is surrounded by wooded, rolling hills and by the city of Berkeley. Berkeley has a long history as one of Americaâs most lively, culturally diverse, and politically adventurous cities. The surrounding San Francisco Bay Area offers culture, entertainment, and natural beauty without rival, much of which is accessible by BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit). Research programs at Berkeley are conducted within teaching departments, institutes, and centers (sometimes referred to as Organized Research Units or ORUs). Institutes and centers are established and administered separately from the teaching units. They are interdisciplinary in nature and organized around the work of a group of faculty and graduate students whose research interests transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. They do not offer courses of instruction or degrees, although several work in conjunction with interdepartmental instruction programs which lead to bachelorâs or advanced degrees. Institutes and centers provide invaluable experience for graduate students in basic and applied research and greatly enhance Berkeleyâs educational program and the overall academic quality of the University.The quality of Berkeleyâs student body complements the stature of its faculty. Most students are Californians, but nearly every state and most foreign countries are represented. The student body can best be characterized by its diversity; more than half of the students are minorities, helping to produce the wide range of opinion and perspective essential to a great university."
